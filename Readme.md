Vendor Comparison using Fine-tuned Phi3 Model
Project Overview
This project focuses on fine-tuning the Phi3 model for vendor comparison. Data was collected from IndiaMART, and the model was optimized using Unsloth. After fine-tuning, the model achieved an accuracy of 94%, providing efficient vendor recommendations based on the dataset.

Key Features
Model: Fine-tuned Phi3 for vendor comparison
Data Source: IndiaMART (Vendor and product data)
Platform: Trained and optimized using Unsloth
Accuracy: 94% after fine-tuning
Dataset
The dataset was collected from IndiaMART, containing detailed vendor information, including:

Vendor name
Product categories
Pricing
Location and availability
Model Fine-tuning
The Phi3 model was fine-tuned using the Unsloth platform, with the following steps:

Data preprocessing, including feature selection and cleaning.
Fine-tuning Phi3 on collected vendor data.
Validation and testing using a custom similarity metric to compare vendors.
Results
The fine-tuned model reached an accuracy of 94% in vendor comparison, making it highly effective in recommending suitable vendors based on various product and service features.
